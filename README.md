# Task 1: Smart Light Control

## Overview
This project involves designing a system to control an LED light using a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) and a mobile app.

## Deliverable
A working prototype where the light responds to app-based commands.

## How to Use
1. Set up the microcontroller as per the circuit diagram in `docs/`.
2. Upload the code in `src/` to the microcontroller.
3. Use the provided mobile app to control the light.


# Task 2: Home Automation

## Overview
Develop a home automation prototype to control multiple devices (lights, fans) using IoT platforms like Blynk or MQTT.

## Deliverable
A prototype controlled via a smartphone or web application.

## How to Use
1. Install the required IoT platform (Blynk/MQTT).
2. Connect the devices as per the wiring diagram in `docs/`.
3. Use the mobile app or web interface to control the devices.

# Task 3: Security System

## Overview
This project involves building a security system that detects motion, captures images, and sends alerts to a mobile app.

## Deliverable
A functional security prototype with real-time alerts.

## How to Use
1. Set up the motion sensor and camera modules.
2. Upload the code in `src/` to the microcontroller.
3. Configure the mobile app to receive alerts.

# Task 4: Air Quality Monitor

## Overview
Build a device to monitor air quality (e.g., PM2.5, CO2 levels) and display the data on a cloud dashboard.

## Deliverable
A system showing live air quality metrics and historical trends.

## How to Use
1. Connect the air quality sensors as per the instructions in `docs/`.
2. Use the code in `src/` to collect and upload data to the cloud.
3. Access the cloud dashboard to view live and historical data.
